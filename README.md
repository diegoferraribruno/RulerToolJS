# RulerToolJS
A basic ruler and "draw" tool made with css html and javaScript
It works but what is it good for? Well, you can use the source code to learn something about html css and jasvascript.
That is it. nothing too fancy.  you can also spend a lot of time clicking top down - left to right to draw numbered DIVs
than in your browser you can inspect the html file and copy the divs you have made andthen hardcode them to your code.
and do not forget to coppy all the css part too because there is something important ther wich makes the borders to be 
included in the size of the object not making it larger.

this tool is actually going to be part os something bigger in a near future. (or not)
